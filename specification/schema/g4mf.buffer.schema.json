Buffer data may be stored in one of three ways: in an extenal file, in a base64-encoded string, or in the case of binary G4MF files (`.glb`), the buffer at index 0 is used for the data chunk after the JSON at the end of the file. As an analogy, if a buffer view is a partition and an accessor is a file system, then a buffer is the whole disk.",

For a binary G4MF file, the buffer at index 0 MUST NOT have a URI."
