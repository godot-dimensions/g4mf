	"description": "Mesh surface bindings define how data is associated with mesh elements such as vertices, edges, and simplexes. For example, the tetrahedra of a 4D mesh surface may have texture map coordinates, normals, colors, or other data associated with each corner of the tetrahedra. Bindings define an array of data, and indices which sample that data for specific mesh elements.",
