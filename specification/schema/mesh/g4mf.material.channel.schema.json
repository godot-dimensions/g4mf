Use `values` to store the channel data (colors, normals, etc.) and populate the binding's index properties (such as `vertices`, `edges`, `simplexes`, or `geometry` decompositions) to control whether the data is per-vertex, per-edge, per-simplex, or per-geometry element."

If used together with other properties, this acts as a modulate which is per-component multiplied with the other properties. The color is represented as an array of usually three or four numbers, each usually in the range 0.0 to 1.0, but may go above 1.0 for overbright colors.",

A texture map, also known as a UV map or UVW map, contains texture coordinates, and information on how those coordinates bind to domains. The `values` accessor within the texture map MUST have its vector size set to the dimension of the texture space, MUST have a floating-point `componentType`, and the numbers within are usually on a range of 0.0 to 1.0."
